## Project Overview
This project tests the effect of modality imbalance in federated multimodal learning. The current setup uses a base vision language model [`Qwen-2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct). 
The fine-tuning is performed using [Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)] (https://github.com/huggingface/peft) method [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314).
